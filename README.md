`encryptrpak` is an extension for the
[encryptr](https://github.com/SurgicalInformatics/encryptr) package,
adding new features to help encrypt/decrypt files of R packages.

Please note that `encryptrpak` is not related in any way with the
`encryptr` developer team.

## Installation

`encryptrpak` is still at the
[experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
stage of development. That means people can use the package and provide
feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `encryptrpak` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/encryptrpak")
```

## Citation

If you use `encryptrpak` in your research, please consider citing it. We
put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R
package. You can find the `encryptrpak` citation below.
