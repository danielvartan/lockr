# lockr (development version)

# lockr 0.3.0 (2023-03-20)

* `encryptrpak` was renamed to `lockr`.
* `encryptr` and `devtools`are no longer in the import dependence list.
* `encrypt_extdata()` and `decrypt_extdata()` were superseded and removed from
  the package.
* `get_private_key()`, `get_public_key()`, `get_private_key_path()`, and
  `get_public_key_path()` were removed from the package. Please use `openssl`
  for reading keys.
* `rsa_keygen()` was added. This function facilitates the creation of RSA key
  pairs.
* `lock_file()` and `unlock_file()` were added. These functions allow the user
  to encrypt/decrypt individual files.
* `lock_dir()` and `unlock_dir()` were added. These functions allow the user
  to encrypt/decrypt all files inside a directory.

# encryptrpak 0.2.0 (2021-11-11)

* `get_private_key_path()` and `get_public_key_path()` are now exported
  functions.
* An argument called `devtools_load` was added to `get_private_key()`,
  `get_public_key()`, `get_private_key_path()`, `get_public_key_path()`,
  `encrypt_extdata()`, and `decrypt_extdata()`. This allows developers to load
  packages to memory before running the functions. The `devtools_load` argument
  is always set to `FALSE`.


# encryptrpak 0.1.0 (2021-11-04)

* First `lockr` release. ðŸŽ‰


# encryptrpak 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
