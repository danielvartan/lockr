`encryptrpak` is an extension for the [encryptr](https://github.com/SurgicalInformatics/encryptr) package, adding new features to encrypt/decrypt files of R packages.

Please note that `encryptrpak` is not related in any way with the `encryptr` developer team.

See also other utility or extension packages created by the GIPSO developer team:

* [`gutils`](https://github.com/gipso/encryptrpak): an R package with a collection of utility functions created by the GIPSO developer team.
* [`lubritime`](https://github.com/gipso/lubritime): an extension for the [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package to deal with time in R.

## Installation

`encryptrpak` will be always at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development. We don't intend to publish this package to CRAN.

You can install `encryptrpak` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/encryptrpak")
```

## Citation

If you use `encryptrpak` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `encryptrpak` citation below.

```{r}
