`encryptrpak` is an extension for the [encryptr](https://github.com/SurgicalInformatics/encryptr) package, adding new features to help encrypt/decrypt files of R packages.

Please note that `encryptrpak` is not related in any way with the `encryptr` developer team.

## Installation

`encryptrpak` is still at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development. That means people can use the package and provide feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `encryptrpak` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/encryptrpak")
```

## Citation

If you use `encryptrpak` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `encryptrpak` citation below.

```{r}
citation("encryptrpak")
```
